Q. Define a function and call in tex.

\fi

\textbf{Definition:}

A function $f$ is a relation between two sets $A$ and $B$ such that for each element $x$ in set $A$, there is exactly one element $y$ in set $B$ such that the ordered pair $(x,y)$ is in the relation.

\textbf{Example:}

Let $A = \{1,2,3\}$ and $B = \{a,b,c\}$. Define a function $f$ from $A$ to $B$ as follows:

$f(1) = a$, $f(2) = b$, $f(3) = c$.

We can call this function $f$ in the following way:

$f(2) = b$
