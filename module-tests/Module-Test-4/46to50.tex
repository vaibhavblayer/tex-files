\item A particle is projected with velocity $20 m/s$, so that it just clears two walls of equal height $10m$, which are at a distance $20 m$ from each other. The time of passing between the walls is :

\begin{enumerate}
\item $2 s$\ans
\item $2\sqrt{10} s$
\item $10\sqrt{2} s$
\item $1/2 s$

\item A rescue plane is flying horizontally at a speed of $30 m/s$ and at an altitude of $125 m $ when it drops a warning flare. Neglecting air resistance and assuming that the plane doesn't change its course, speed, altitude, how far from the plane is the flare when it hits the ground?

\begin{enumerate}
\item $146 m$

\item Two particles are simultaneously projected in opposite directions horizontally from a given point in space where gravity $`g'$ is uniform. If $u_1$ and $u_2$ be their initial speeds then the time $t$ after which their velocities are mutually perpendicular is given by :
\begin{multicols}{4}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\dfrac{\sqrt{u_1u_2}}{g}$\ans
\item $\dfrac{\sqrt{u_1^2u_2^2}}{g}$
\item $\dfrac{\sqrt{u_1(u_1 + u_2)}}{g}$

\item A ball is projected from a point at two different angles with same speed $u$ and land at same point in both the cases :
\begin{enumerate}
\item the difference between two angles of projection is $90^\circ$
\item the maximum height attained by the ball in both the cases is equal
\item the sum of maximum heights for the two cases is $u^2/(2g)$\ans
\item the maximum height attained by the ball in one case must be twice of the maximum height attained by the ball in second case
