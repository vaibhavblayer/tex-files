\item A particle is projected vertically upwards from a point A on the ground. It takes time $t_1$ to reach a point B, but it still continues to move up. If it takes further $t_2$ time to reach the ground from point B. Then height of point B from the ground is
\begin{tasks}(2)
\task $\dfrac{1}{2}g(t_1 + t_2)^2$
\task $gt_1t_2$
\task $\dfrac{1}{8}g(t_1 + t_2)^2$
\task $\dfrac{1}{2}gt_1  t_2$\ans
\end{tasks}

\item A very broad elevator is going up vertically with a constant acceleration of $2 m/s^2$. At the instant when its velocity is $4 m/s$ a ball is projected from the floor of the lift with a speed of $4m/s$ relative to the floor at an elevation of $30^\circ$. The time taken by the ball to return the floor is
\begin{tasks}(2)
\task $\dfrac{1}{2}s$
\task $\dfrac{1}{3}s$\ans
\task $\dfrac{1}{4}s$
\task $1s$
\end{tasks}


\item A body freely falling from the rest has a velocity $v$ after it falls through a height $h$. The distance it has to fall down for its velocity to become double, is
\begin{tasks}(2)
\task $2h$
\task $4h$\ans
\task $6h$
\task $8h$
\end{tasks}


\item A ball is thrown vertically upwards from the ground. It crosses a point at the height of $25 m$ twice at an interval of $4 s$. The ball was thrown with the velocity of :
\begin{tasks}(2)
\task $20 m/s$
\task $25 m/s$
\task $30 m/s$\ans
\task $35 m/s$
\end{tasks}

\item A man in a balloon rising vertically with an acceleration of $4.9 m/s^2$ releases a ball $2s$ after the balloon is let go from the ground. The greatest height above the ground reached by the ball is ($g = 9.8 m/s^2$)
\begin{tasks}(2)
\task $14.7 m$\ans
\task $19.6 m$
\task $9.8 m$
\task $24.5 m$
\end{tasks}
