%1
\item A point moves in a straight line, so that its displacement $x$ at time $t$ is given by $x^2=t^2+1$. Its acceleration is
\begin{tasks}(2)
    \task $\dfrac{1}{x}$
    \task $\dfrac{1}{x^3}$\ans
    \task $-\dfrac{1}{x^2}$
    \task $-\dfrac{1}{x^3}$
\end{tasks}

%2
\item A point initially at rest moves along X-axis. Its acceleration varies with time as $a=(6t+5)\mpss$. If it starts from origin, then the distance covered in $2\s$ is
\begin{tasks}(2)
    \task $20\m$
    \task $18\m$\ans
    \task $16\m$
    \task $25\m$
\end{tasks}

%3
\item A particle moves along a straight line. Its position at any instant is given by $x=32t-\dfrac{8t^3}{4}$, where $x$ is in metre and $t$ is in second. Find the acceleration of the particle at the instant when particle is at rest.
\begin{tasks}(2)
    \task $-16\mpss$
    \task $-27.6\mpss$\ans
    \task $32\mpss$
    \task $16\mpss$
\end{tasks}

%4
\item The displacement of a particle is given by $x=(t-2)^2$, where $x$ is in metre and $t$ in second. The distance covered by the particle in first $4$ seconds is
\begin{tasks}(2)
    \task $4\m$
    \task $8\m$\ans
    \task $12\m$
    \task $16\m$
\end{tasks}

%5
\item The position $x$ of a particle with respect to time $t$ along X-axis is given by $x=9t^2-t^3$, where $x$ is in metres and $t$ in second. What will be the position of this particle when it achieves maximum speed along the positive x-direction ?
\begin{tasks}(2)
    \task $24\m$
    \task $32\m$
    \task $54\m$\ans
    \task $81\m$
\end{tasks}

\item It is possible to project a particle on a level ground with a given velocity in 2 possible ways so as to have the same range $R$. The product of the corresponding times of flight is then :
\begin{tasks}(2)
\task $\dfrac{R}{g}$
\task $\dfrac{2R}{g}$\ans
\task $\dfrac{R}{2g}$
\task None of these
