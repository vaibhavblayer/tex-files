\item It is possible to project a particle on a level ground with a given velocity in 2 possible ways so as to have the same range $R$. The product of the corresponding times of flight is then :
\begin{tasks}(2)
\task $\dfrac{R}{g}$
\task $\dfrac{2R}{g}$\ans
\task $\dfrac{R}{2g}$
\task None of these
\end{tasks}

\item A body is projected with an angle $\theta$. The maximum height reached is $h$. If the time of flight is $4\s$ and $g=10\mpss$, then value of $h$ is
